## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3, without any extra library beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python required.
## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a> 
This is a data analysis project for Udacity's data scientist nano degree course. The task is to answer key business questions by analyzing the Seattle data provided by Airbnb.
I was interested in the following questions:

1. Is Seattle in general an attractive city to tourists, thus the overall trend of users of Airbnb is growing? In other words, is the Seattle market promising and growing at a fast pace?Â 

2. When is the busiest season to rent for maximum revenue and when is the off-peak season for maintenance?

3. What are the factors that impact the listing price of a property on Airbnb?

## File Description <a name="files"></a>
There are 1 notebook available to showcase work related to the above questions. The notebook imports data, conduct necessary data pre-processing and cleaning, perform data analysis or modeling to answer the three business questions. Markdown cellls were used to assist in walking through the thought process.
## Results <a name="results"></a>
